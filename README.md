	-Works for Steam users with or without personalized Steam IDs
	
	Side Note: Why does steam use an old Jquery? makes this so much harder :)
	Mini ID's for steam are used because...
		-Not everyone has a steam ID set up
		-Users with steam IDs also have profile links, which can mess up coding
		-Steam mini ID's are the only consistent ID (and easier to get) to use
