Made by tjtheturtleisawesome(Jayleen Li)  
	Steam Profile: http://steamcommunity.com/id/tjtheturtleisawesome/  
	GitHub: https://github.com/jayleenli  
	  
	Version 1.0 Features
	-Filtering your Steam Activity by friends list!
	-Hides the following types of posts from unselected users
		*Screenshots
		*New Games
		*Status Posts
		*Favorites
	-Storing your filter preferences in Chrome Storage
	-Works for Steam users with or without personalized Steam IDs
	
	Side Note: Why does steam use an old Jquery? makes this so much harder :)
	Mini ID's for steam are used because...
		-Not everyone has a steam ID set up
		-Users with steam IDs also have profile links, which can mess up coding
		-Steam mini ID's are the only consistent ID (and easier to get) to use
